          <blockquote>
            <p>Today’s students have grown up in a world where they can custom tailor their own view of information and data using the ever expanding set of tools available through social media and the internet. How does your institution's technology infrastructure match up with that expectation?</p>

            <h3>Readiness Assessment</h3>
            <p>Campus hacking can provide valuable new opportunities for learning, collaboration and community engagement. But only if universities are correctly position to take advantage of it.</p>

            <p>A readiness assessment will provide an overview of current campus hacking activities - what are students building? What data and information are they looking for? What is the experience or interaction that students are interested in customizing through the development of a new app or service?</p>

            <p>This assessment will also evaluate an institution’s current IT infrastructure and available data. Is the information that students are looking for readily available in a useable format? Is it made available in a comprehensive format and updated regularly? Are students forced to resort to less than optimal ways of acquiring desired data and information?</p>

            <p>The outcome of this process is a view of the changes that students want to see in their campus experience. Understanding this can empower university administrators and leadership to better support innovative new activities and capitalize on enhanced learning opportunities.</p>

          <div id="consulting">
            <h3>Expert Consulting</h3>
            <p>The challenges that universities face in developing platforms for collaborating with student innovators are almost identical to those faced by governments working to adapt to the growing open data movement. The notion of “government as a platform” is easily applied to colleges and universities as well.</p>

            <p>Providing recommendations and action items that are based on real world experience in the world of government and other large institutions is invaluable as institutions of higher education begin to transition to a world with the “university as a platform” is a reality.</p>

            <p>Based on the outcome of the readiness assessment, we provide a detailed list of action items that colleges and universities can take to best position themselves to support student hacking activities.</p>

          <div id="planning">
            <h3>Event Planning</h3>
            <p>One milestone on the road to the “university as a platform” is organizing student activities and events that can support creative thinking and innovation. Designing these events properly is no trivial undertaking for institutions that are new to the hacker culture.</p>

            <p>Providing a set of guidelines based on experience with the most successful events happening across the country is essential to getting the most out these events, and fostering a lasting culture of innovation on campus.</p>

            <p>We help plan events that are built on practices developed at the most successful college hackathons across the country, and similar types of events happening in government and other industries. We provide a blueprint that can be used to develop repeatable events that will showcase the creativity and innovation at your school for the entire world to see.</p>
