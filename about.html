        <h2>Why Campus Hacking?</h2>
        <blockquote>
        <p>"[S]tudents are showing up the universities that trained them by producing faster, easier-to-navigate, more informative and generally just better versions of the information systems at the heart of undergraduate life."<br /> -- Read the entire story from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/nyregion/students-inventing-programs-to-streamline-their-colleges-data.html">New York Times</a>.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Institutions of higher education produce graduates that are creative thinkers and problem solvers. Students want access to raw data so that they can customize the way they consume information and interact with large institutions like employers, universities and government. This appetite for data and information is what is fueling the <a href="http://opengovernmentdata.org/">open data movement</a> in government across the U.S. and around the world.</p>

      <p>Increasingly, we see this same trend coming to colleges and universities, as students apply the skills they learn in Computer Science and other fields of study to customize their interactions with their schools. Students now have <a href="http://2014f.pennapps.com/">the skills and the tools they need</a> to design their own services and applications - applications for learning more about their fellow students, finding the best classes or event to help <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/pennapps-spring-2013/hacks/takenote">take notes</a>.</p>

      <p>The parallels between what is starting to happen on college campuses and what has been happening for the last several years in the world of <a href="http://www.ctg.albany.edu/publications/reports/opendata">open government</a> are remarkable. Governments are now grappling with ways to restructure their technology platforms and their internal management culture to support new ways of interacting with citizens.</p>

      <p>Colleges and universities will soon face similar pressures - to the extent that they are not already - as more and more students arrive on campus with the expectation that they will be able to customize their own campus experience through a practice that is widely referred to as “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(programmer_subculture)">hacking</a>.” This trend has the potential to create valuable new opportunities for learning, collaboration and community engagement. But only if universities are correctly position to take advantage of it.</p>

      <p>It’s time for colleges and universities to <a href="services.html">make sure</a> their technology infrastructure and their management philosophy are aligned with the the increasingly prevalent expectations of students to customize their campus experience.</p>
